This sample project showcases how to generate the package for the Cloud Scale Unit. The project consumes the Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Sdk.ScaleUnit to generate the package.
Edit the project file and include the required extension project(Commerce runtime, Channel database and POS extension project) as project reference and then build the project to generate the output Cloud Scale Unit package. 

Based on the extension projects added as reference, the project parses the added reference project and generate the Cloud Scale Unitpackage. All the required config files (CommerceRuntime.Ext, Web.config) for the Cloud Scale Unit package will be auto generated by the Cloud Scale Unit packaging project, don't edit these files.
